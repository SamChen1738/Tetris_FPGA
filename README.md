# Tetris
## About
This is a recreation of the classic game Tetris on the Basys 3 FPGA. The game logic was implemented using finite state machines and several sequential components. The game can be controlled via the buttons on the Basys 3 board and is integrated with VGA output, providing live rendering of block movement and interactions. The 7 segment display is used to keep track of the score, which is simply the number of rows the player has cleared.
