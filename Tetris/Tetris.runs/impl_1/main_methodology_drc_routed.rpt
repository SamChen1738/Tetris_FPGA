TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -3.652 ns between vga/v_count_reg_reg[4]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and rgb_reg_reg[11]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

There is a large setup violation of -3.933 ns between vga/v_count_reg_reg[4]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and rgb_reg_reg[7]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
